• Detail description of exactly what your code is doing (about a 
paragraph at minimum)

• Explicitly show how to install your code in point-by-point fashion
• I will copy and paste the instructions onto the command line for 
installation
• If you are using a jupyter notebook, please do not state “open jupyter 
notebook” – explain to a novice how to do this 

o Usage instructions
• How do I run your code – Keep in mind I am used to running my 
programs on the command line and I don’t use an IDE – so how do I 
run your code? 

o Method

• You can put those in a graph or table
